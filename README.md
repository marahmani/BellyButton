# BellyButton

A biological researcher by the name of Rosa, is interested in bacteria that is in beef, she hypothesizes that the ideal synthetic bacteria found in the beef may be found in bacteria in humans’ belly button. To test this hypothesis, she has gathered samples of navel from different people. The identities of these people are hidden. Each have been given an id number. Rosa wants to create a dashboard so everyone can access it by entering their id numbers to see what type of bacteria is residing in their navel area.
On her dashboard, she needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. She wants her volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. She wants to create three different chart so each candidate can see the result once entering their id number in the dashboard.

For a better understanding look at the bellow screenshot:

Three charts are : Horizontal Bar Chart, Bubble Chart,  Gauge Chart
in the next image we will see the charts based on one id number 940.

As shown, when the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data displays in the dashboard, and the three charts are working according to their requirements. Also, when a sample is selected, the dashboard displays the data in the panel and all three charts according to their requirements.
